                    kind of collective effort on the first weekend and finish it on the second? â€” we work hard on the
                    planning of some little extras for you. For example, there will be a small IndieWeb area directly

                <h2>Travel Assistance</h2>
                <p>The IndieWeb community is building the foundation of a web controlled by individuals for themselves.
                    It's crucial to have independent web creators from all backgrounds at the IndieWebCamps to have a
                    rich
                    discussion and build cool things.</p>
                <p>Inspired by last year's <a href="http://2016.indieweb.org" target="IndieWebSummit 2016 website"
                                              target="_blank">IndieWeb summit</a> â€” and with the help of some generous
                    sponsors (details to follow shortly) â€” Joschi and Marc are pleased to provide a small
                    <strong>travel assistance fund</strong>. If you are a member of a group that is typically
                    underrepresented (e.g. if you are not hetero, white,
                    cis and male), and otherwise could not afford to travel to one or both of the IndieWebWeek camps on
                    your own, we might be able to assist you with travel and/or lodging costs.</p>

                    no later than March 31st, 2017</strong>. You needn't be an IndieWeb
                    expert or master hacker, just an excited participant willing to share and learn.</p>
