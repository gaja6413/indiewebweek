# IndieWeb Week Website

The web root is served from "public". Place any publicly available files there. Put libraries and other code outside of this folder.

Leave the "github" folder as is, it is used to deploy the website when this repository is updated.

Every push to "master" will deploy the website. If you want to add commits without deploying, please create a new branch and send a pull request to master when ready to deploy.
