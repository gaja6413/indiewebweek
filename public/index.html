As a member of a group that is typically underrepresented (e.g. if you are not hetero, white, cis and male) and otherwise could not afford to travel to one or both of the IndieWebWeek camps on your own, we offered to assist you with travel and/or lodging costs.</p><p>Applications for the fund closed on March 31st and we're very happy to announce that we could take over the major part of expenses for two applicants.
